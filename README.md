# LevelUP
 
My level is divided into four sections, each with a different gameplay focus.

The first section is designed to ease players into the level. It contains only two Mortars, allowing players to learn how to dodge the Mortar projectiles. The projectiles create explosion circles that damage any player inside, with damage based on distance to the explosion center.

The second section is a free-for-all arena. Players battle AI bots with similar abilities. The bots wander aimlessly until players enter, then pursue them. This section also contains collectibles like coins and health packs for scoring and healing.

The third section is a maze containing the new proximity mine enemy. Proximity mines are inspired by landmines - if a player gets too close, they explode after a short delay, damaging the player. The maze requires careful navigation to avoid the mines.

The fourth and final section is the victory area. Inside a temple, players find the goal tile. Approaching it ends the game and displays a win screen.

My intent with this progression was to slowly ramp up complexity and difficulty. The first section teaches a new enemy, the second tests those skills in a hectic battle, the third adds more spatial awareness requirements, and the fourth provides a sense of accomplishment.

Placing collectibles and new enemies in specific areas reinforces this learning curve. For example, the maze section combines a new enemy with navigational challenges, demanding greater focus and precision from players. Winning provides a satisfying climax after overcoming the escalating level elements.

In summary, I aimed to create a logical difficulty progression that starts simple and adds complexity until culminating in victory. The layout, enemies and challenges were purposefully designed to guide players through this experience.
